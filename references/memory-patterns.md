# Memory Patterns (Daily + Long-Term)

## Files
- **Daily log**: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (raw notes, events, links)
- **Long-term memory**: `MEMORY.md` (curated, stable facts only)

## Distillation Rules
- Only keep what survives a restart: preferences, guardrails, key configs.
- Remove transient task details after completion.
- Summarize big threads into 1–3 bullets with pointers.

## Cadence
- Distill daily logs periodically into `MEMORY.md`.
- Keep `MEMORY.md` short and actionable.

# Continuous Learning (Hooks → Skills)

## Two-Layer Approach
- **Hooks (deterministic)**: Use pre/post tool hooks to capture atomic “instincts.”
- **Skills (probabilistic)**: Distill clusters of instincts into reusable skills.

## OpenClaw Adaptation
- Session-start: load minimal context (SOUL/USER + today’s memory).
- Session-end: write summaries + extract repeat patterns.
- Pre-compact: save critical state before context loss.

## Confidence Scoring
- Score instincts 0.3–0.9 based on reliability.
- Promote only high-confidence patterns into skills.
